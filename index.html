        <p>Software Developer in a complex and fast pace development environment. 
        I work with a small team of developers and across multiple teams for specific tasks. 
        A significant portion of my time is dedicated to supporting and debugging systems I did not write, which has helped my troubleshooting and code understanding abilities. 
        As tasks change I am required to pick up any new skills needed, such as learning a new language, toolkit, or libraries.</p>
        <p>Majority of the work is in C, C++ and C#, I have also created several tools for automation and code generation in Python.</p>

        <p>Software developer for the Center of Instruction Research and Technology Department (CIRT). 
        I created custom applications for various needs across campus, including software optimized for specific hardware devices provided to me by the clients.
        These tasks required project management, producing project completion estimates, and project scope management to prevent run-away projects. 
        I was also given time for research and development which I used to create a scheduling tool that ISU still uses and supports for scheduling classes. </p>
        <p>Because of the wide range of tasks I performed, I used a variety of languages including: C++, C, Python, PHP, Java, SQL, HTML, and many others.</p>

        <p>Research grant researcher and developer. 
        I joined a group of professors for a research grant that was using an artificial network system. 
        During this research I learned to use the original software tools used to reproduce old research. 
        I automated this software via simulated keyboard and mouse inputs as there was no automation support. 
        I used various linux tools including cron, xvfb, and gnuplot in order to automate data collection and analysis.</p>
        <p>Creative problem solving was required to overcome the difficulties that arose during the research. This problem solving led me to use C++, Java, and Python throughout the project.</p>
